### FIGURE AND GROUND

The ‘figure’ is the object that is intuitively as well as visibly separated from the ground.

The most classic example that exists is that of the grail cup — the vase between two mirroring face silhouettes. When you first come across this image, your eyes are drawn to the most focally visual object that comes into your notice immediately, which might be the faces opposing each other or the vase. While your mind is adjusting your focus, the ground or the vase is blurred out and at that moment, your mind intuitively crops out the negative or the ground in the image.

After a while, you get to notice the vase in the background and realize it was there in the first place. As ambiguous as [the Figure and Ground principle](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/design-principles-space-figure-ground-relationship/) seems, designers usually create visually appealing surreal and illusionary art and web designs.

Sometimes, the [relationship between figure and ground](http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/gestalt_principles.htm) is stable, which makes both distinguishable from one another. This relationship is sometimes unstable, meaning that the figure and ground are indistinguishable from each other. Due to the ambiguousness of this relationship, the viewers confront perceptual confusion.

To give you a clear idea of how the figure-ground relationship influences web design, let’s discuss a few examples in detail. Each of these examples focus on **three main areas of the figure-ground relationship**: You can add explicit visual cues by using contrast, boxes, and shadows for your web design. These techniques are used to distinguish the color, size, and level of detail, to separate the content, and to add depth to the respective object of focus.

In the first example below, [Trellis](http://www.trellisfarm.com/) uses a ‘hero image’ (images with clear CTAs) with a figure-ground relationship that clearly indicates the level of detail, color, and size.

*Trellis ([Large preview](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3e731c4a-8315-41c5-9766-dfca33a91d8d/gestalt-principles-trellis-website.png)) ([Image source](http://www.trellisfarm.com/))*

![https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3e731c4a-8315-41c5-9766-dfca33a91d8d/gestalt-principles-trellis-website.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3e731c4a-8315-41c5-9766-dfca33a91d8d/gestalt-principles-trellis-website.png)

The text is the figure here in a large cursive font in the center of the page, making it stand out as compared to the image in the background. The white text over the contrasting grayscale image draws the focus of attention, which makes the text visible over it. From another perspective, the background is blurred so that the text pops out as the figure. All of these aspects show that **the text here is prioritized as the figure or the positive space**, while the blurred image is used as background or the negative space, hence strongly implying the concept of figure and ground.

Next comes the content in boxes. [Ocean Health Index](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/) makes a smart use of boxed content to separate the figure from the background. This is what you see when you come across their website:

*Ocean Health Index ([Large preview](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/30d944bf-160a-4b3a-ab35-8f37c2949f4d/gestalt-principles-ocean-health-index-website.png)) ([Image source](http://www.oceanhealthindex.org/))*

![https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/30d944bf-160a-4b3a-ab35-8f37c2949f4d/gestalt-principles-ocean-health-index-website.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/30d944bf-160a-4b3a-ab35-8f37c2949f4d/gestalt-principles-ocean-health-index-website.png)

Which part of it jumps at you when you first view this web page? If you ask me, it’s the main text in white in the upper right-hand side and the two boxes with contrasting color and text. The bold white text on the top is obviously the figure. (Notice how it’s placed over the darker image to stand out.) The boxes down below are also part of the figure, due to the contrast they offer to the ground image. The other aspect of this figure is the second contrast that is placed inside the boxes in the form of contrastive-colored text.

The background uses subtle shades that help the figures appear sharply, showing **a pattern of detail** here. The boxes are also overlapping the background image, bringing them in clear view over the image.

Some websites also exhibit the figure-ground relationship by adding drop shadows to the figure, in order to give a feeling that the figure is placed over the background. Here’s a screenshot from [Seriously Unsweetened](http://www.drinkseriously.com/):

*Seriously Unsweetened ([Large preview](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ae8a8735-7d06-4b9e-a539-60d3cb5e972b/gestalt-principles-seriously-unsweetened-website.png)) ([Image source](http://www.drinkseriously.com/))*

![https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ae8a8735-7d06-4b9e-a539-60d3cb5e972b/gestalt-principles-seriously-unsweetened-website.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ae8a8735-7d06-4b9e-a539-60d3cb5e972b/gestalt-principles-seriously-unsweetened-website.png)

Seriously Unsweetened’s landing page uses more than one technique to maintain that figure-ground relationship in a balanced manner. There are bright colors and shadows. The ground remains white, making it easier for the figure to appear accurately above the ground. In the positive space, the objects in the figure are presented under an illusion as of being ‘on the top’ of the background. The shadow game is played inside the primary figure, making us notice that there is another figure-ground relationship within the main figure. A clever one!

### PROXIMITY

Elements arranged close to each other are perceived as more related than those placed further apart. This way different elements are viewed mainly as a group rather than as individual elements.

# **How does the Proximity principle apply to UI design?**

We can use the Proximity principle in UI design for grouping similar information, organising content and decluttering layouts. Its correct use will have a positive impact on visual communication and user experience.

As the principle states, items that are related should stay close to each other, while the unrelated items should stay further apart. White space plays a vital role here as it creates contrast guiding the users’ eyes in the intended direction. White space can boost visual hierarchy and information flow, contributing in easy to read and scan layouts. It will help users achieve their goals faster and delve deeper into the content.

*We can apply the Proximity principle pretty much everywhere from navigation, cards, galleries and banners to lists, body text and pagination.*

Here is an example of proximity as displayed in the navigation of the [Mashable](https://mashable.com/) website:

*Mashable ([Large preview](https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/64a68255-2d55-477f-b352-0f1640aa9937/gestalt-principles-mashable-website.png)) ([Image source](https://mashable.com/))*

![https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/64a68255-2d55-477f-b352-0f1640aa9937/gestalt-principles-mashable-website.png](https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/w_400/https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/64a68255-2d55-477f-b352-0f1640aa9937/gestalt-principles-mashable-website.png)

In the snapshot above, you can clearly notice how the elements of the same category are placed together to show the relation with the main menu type. The users’ eyes are automatically drawn to the subtypes under the main heading — also **thanks to the use of colors and text size**. You can see that the items that are unrelated are set apart with the help of a line, which serves as the users’ guide in relating and separating the items as per the principle of proximity.

# **Common Region**

Similarly to the Proximity principle, elements placed within the same region are perceived as grouped.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*VxBcEZmTiwn6GhzMZTcyIw.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*VxBcEZmTiwn6GhzMZTcyIw.png)

# **How does the Common Region principle apply to UI design?**

The Common Region principle is particularly useful. It can help with information grouping and content organisation, but it can also achieve content separation or act as a focal point. It boosts hierarchy, scanability and assists in promoting information.

The Common Region principle can hold together many different elements keeping them unified within larger groups. We can achieve it with the use of line, colour, shape and shadow. It can often be used to bring elements into the foreground, indicating interaction or importance.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/2008/1*v8mRsx28je9GFlIasdMPgQ.jpeg](https://miro.medium.com/max/2008/1*v8mRsx28je9GFlIasdMPgQ.jpeg)

*A good Common Region example would be the card UI pattern; a well defined rectangular space with different bits of information presented as one. Banners and tables are good examples as well.*

# **Similarity**

Elements sharing similar visual characteristics are perceived to be more related than those not sharing similar characteristics.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*qnR1RWW8tN-OUfzlUR2ggQ.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*qnR1RWW8tN-OUfzlUR2ggQ.png)

# **How does the Similarity principle apply to UI design?**

We tend to perceive similar to each other elements as grouped or a pattern. We also might think that they serve the same purpose. Similarity can help us with organising and classifying objects within a group and linking them with a specific meaning or function.

There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape). When Similarity occurs, an object can get emphasised by being different from the rest; this is called ‘Anomaly’ and can be used to create contrast or visual weight. It can draw the user’s attention to a specific piece of content (focal point) while assisting with scanability, discoverability and the overall flow.

*We can use the principle of Similarity in navigation, links, buttons, headings, call to actions and more.*

- Closure

Closure is when our brains

Our brains tend to ‘close’ the gaps in the incomplete objects and use our visual perception to complete the figure, seeing it as a whole.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*LxCr2o4bLGzzZpYp3tPtFw.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*LxCr2o4bLGzzZpYp3tPtFw.png)

# **How does the Closure principle apply to UI design?**

As the Closure principle states, when presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump to conclusions by filling in the gaps and creating a unified whole. This way we can decrease the number of elements needed to communicate information, reducing complexity and making designs more engaging. Closure can help us minimise visual noise and convey a message, reinforcing a concept within a pretty small space.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/2832/1*akm90Vz-q4eahMEWmnXa3Q.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/2832/1*akm90Vz-q4eahMEWmnXa3Q.png)

*We can use the Closure principle in Iconography, where simplicity helps with communicating meaning, swiftly and clearly.*

![https://manifesto.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/07-web_closure.png](https://manifesto.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/07-web_closure.png)

7. Every time a user is prompted to guess invisible elements by looking at the visible elements, is an example of the principle of ‘closure’. In the example above, 4 images are hidden but there are enough visual elements for the user to understand that the next image is just one click away.

# Continuity

Elements arranged in a line or a soft curve are perceived to be more related than those arranged randomly or in a harsh line.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*qiXDOZnWm_NFprHEcDEp8w.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*qiXDOZnWm_NFprHEcDEp8w.png)

# **How does the Continuity principle apply in UI design?**

Elements following a continuous line are perceived as grouped. The smoother the line segments, the more we see them as a unified shape; our mind prefers the path of least resistance.

Continuity helps us interpret direction and movement through a composition. It takes place when aligning elements and it can help our eyes move smoothly through the page, assisting with legibility. The Continuity principle strengthens the perception of grouped information, creating order and guiding users through different content segments. Disruption of continuity can signal the end of a section drawing attention to a new piece of content.

*The linear arrangement of rows and columns are good examples of Continuity. We can use them in menus and sub-menus, lists, product arrangements, carousels, services or process/progress displays.*

# **Common Fate**

Elements moving towards the same direction are perceived as more related than those moving in different directions, or not moving at all.

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*idl16iEtKFaMKbIuxn-GaA.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/1140/1*idl16iEtKFaMKbIuxn-GaA.png)

# **How does the Common Fate principle apply in UI design?**

Regardless of how far apart are the elements or how dissimilar they might appear, if they are moving or changing together, they are perceived as related. This effect can take place even when movement is implied, by other visual elements.

The Common Fate principle is more potent when elements move synchronised; in the same direction and at the same time and speed. It can help with grouping relevant information and linking actions with results. The disruption of a synchronised movement can grab users’ attention and direct it to a specific element or feature. It can also, establish relationships between different groups or states. **Common Fate can be used to create an intuitive design.**

*We can use the Common Fate principle in expandable menus, accordions, tool-tips, product sliders, parallax scrolls and swiping indicators.*
