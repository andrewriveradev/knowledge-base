- do something with this: Darker color variations are made by lowering brightness and increasing saturation. Brighter color variations are made by increasing brightness and lowering saturation.

- More spacing than you think you need

# **Importance is not by font size, but by font weight**

# “You can say, “I love you,” in Helvetica. And you can say it with Helvetica Extra Light if you want to be really fancy. Or you can say it with the Extra Bold if it’s really intensive and passionate, you know, and it might work.” — Massimo Vignelli

As what Vignelli has said, it is by font weight that we can give emphasis and importance to words. Let’s take a look at the difference of the two examples below:

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*FpW7hrS3PMfQCYScOMXD8w.png?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*FpW7hrS3PMfQCYScOMXD8w.png?q=20)

Font used: Helvetica

From the image above, I used **_32px_** for *I love you* to show that it’s higher hierarchy than *You are my life, my everything,* which is **_23px._** But giving an emphasis to *I love you* doesn’t stop there. It still lacks the contrast we’re looking for in order to set it apart from the subtitle. And so, **font weight** comes to the rescue.

# **_Bonus Tip:_**

![https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Q8UF2mYDKNRf_4RjFpfEbw.png?q=20](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Q8UF2mYDKNRf_4RjFpfEbw.png?q=20)

Using the same format we had before, in Design A, I used 3 different font sizes: **_32px_** (Title), **_23px_** (description), **_16px_** (published) while in Design B only 2 fonts sizes: **_32px_** (Title) and **_23px_** (description + published).

# Contrast formula = size + weight + color

In handling contrast, I go by the formula **_size+weight+color_** than size+size+size/color. In Design B, instead of adding a new font size, I opted to keep my *description’s size* and utilize it in *Published by* and added a touch of color to achieve contrast.

# The goal is not to have various font sizes and few font weights, but fewer font sizes with various weights

# Contrast

Font hierarchy is just not about small to big font sizes. It is about the **right** **_mix of size, weights, and colors that creates contrast. Bigger contrast, the better._**

# **So how do I create better contrast?**

- Don’t use one kind of weight with different font sizes to create contrast and hierarchy.
- Instead, use bolder and darker style for primary content, or smaller and lighter for secondary content (less important).
- Create three kinds of text colors that varies from dark to light (see example below). Usually I use my base color as body text color.
- Don’t be afraid to apply big font gaps to your items (i.e. 24px header, 16px body text, 10px meta etc). Bigger gap = better contrast.

  an online calculator you can use to create better font hierarchy.

- Remember, contrast is = size + weight + color.
- Lastly, make sure to check its contrast ratio. You can use this [calculator](http://leaverou.github.io/contrast-ratio/) to check its accessibility.

from my base color, I move from darker for headlines to lighter for ancillary content.

- Media queries cause a visual jump between font-sizes.
- To achieve fluid typography combine the calc() function in css with viewport units (vw/vw/vmin/vmax). html { font-size: calc(1em + 1vw);}
